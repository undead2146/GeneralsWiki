# Building in CLion with a VC6 \(x86\) Toolchain

## Prerequisites

1. **CLion** installed and configured.
2. **Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (VC6)** installed (assuming it’s installed in the
   default directory).
3. **CMake** installed and configured.
4. **Source code** of the project cloned from the TheSuperHackers repository.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Toolchain in CLion

1. Open **CLion** and go to **File** -> **Settings** -> **Build, Execution,
   Deployment** -> **Toolchains**.
2. Add a new **Toolchain** by clicking the **+** button.
3. Select **System** as the Type (not Visual Studio).
4. Next to the toolchain name, add the **environment** file by clicking the
   **+** button and pointing to the following file:

   ```text
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\VCVARS32.BAT
   ```

5. Set the paths for the tools:
    - **Build Tool**: Choose the `NMAKE.EXE` file from VC6. For example:

      ```text
      C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/VC98/Bin/NMAKE.EXE
      ```

    - **C Compiler**: The `cl.exe` should be detected automatically. If not, set
      it manually to:

      ```text
      C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/VC98/Bin/cl.exe
      ```

    - **C++ Compiler**: The `cl.exe` will also be detected automatically.

## Step 2: Configuring the CMake Profile

1. Go to **File** -> **Settings** -> **Build, Execution, Deployment** -> **CMake**.
2. In this window, select the CMake profile you want to configure (if there
   isn’t one, create a new one).
3. Choose the **Toolchain** you created in the previous step (VC6 Toolchain).
4. Choose the **Generator** as `NMake Makefiles`.
5. Under **CMake options**, add the following generate settings:

   ```text
      -G "NMake Makefiles"
   ```

   Be careful not to set `Preset`, as it will override the generator settings.
6. Add the build directory path under **CMake Build Directory**:

   ```text
   C:\Users\User\Documents\CLion\CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour\build\vc6
   ```

## Step 3: Compiling and Running the Project

1. Now, click the **Build** button in CLion.
2. CLion will start the build process using the VC6 (x86) toolchain.
3. Once the build is successfully completed, a **zerohour.exe** file will be generated.
4. You need to copy the **zerohour.exe** file to the appropriate game directory in order to run the game.

## Notes

- **Visual C++ 6.0 (VC6)** only supports C++98, so avoid using modern C++ features.
- Working with VC6 requires some adjustments, so it’s always a good idea to check
  that the toolchain is working
  properly.
- You can add Release and Debug profiles in CLion to build the project in
  different configurations.
- Admin rights might be required to run VC6 tools, so make sure to run CLion as an administrator.
