# Introduction to GeneralsWiki

Welcome to **GeneralsWiki**, a technical wiki dedicated to documenting the internal and technical aspects of **Command &
Conquer: Generals** and **Zero Hour**. Here, you will find documentation about the code, tools, game assets, libraries,
and various technical components involved in the development of the game.

### Purpose of the Wiki

This wiki is designed to serve as a central resource for anyone interested in the development of the game, the process
of its creation, and the technological dependencies involved. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or simply curious,
you'll find the information you need to understand the development aspects of the game.

This repository will serve as the primary source for the internal wiki of the GitHub repositories. In the future, there
are plans to set up a dedicated website for the wiki, which will provide easier access to the information and help
developers and researchers utilize it more effectively. The internal wiki will be synchronized with this repository
using appropriate tools to ensure consistency and up-to-date documentation. We will keep you updated with more details
as these plans unfold.

### Wiki Structure

The wiki is divided into several main sections:

1. **/Assets**  
   This section contains all the game assets, including graphics, audio, UI, and localization:
    - **/Art** – Contains all graphic assets like textures and 3D models.
    - **/Audio** – Includes all audio assets such as music and sound effects.
    - **/Gui** – Documentation for user interface components.
    - **/Localization** – Houses the files storing translations for different languages.
    - **/GameDesign** – Contains INI files that hold game data and unit behaviors.
    - etc.

2. **/SourceCode**  
   This section includes the actual code and all libraries and tools needed to build the game:
    - **/Builds** – Build guides for different operating systems (Windows, Linux).
    - **/Libraries** – All external dependencies required, such as DirectX, STLport, ZLib, etc.
    - **/Tools** – Internal tools used in the development process, such as NVASM and CRCDiff

3. **/Community**  
   Information about the community of developers and contributors:
    - **community.md** – Documentation on the developer community, forums, and social networks.
    - **modding.md** – Guides and resources for modding the game.
    - **forks.md** – A list of projects and forks derived from the open-source code of the game.

4. **README.md**  
   The main document of the wiki, containing general information about the wiki, its purpose, and how to use it.

### How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute to the wiki, here are a few simple steps:

1. **Find the Relevant Section**: Browse through the various sections of the wiki to see where you can add new
   information or update existing documentation.
2. **Add or Update Documentation**: Add new technical documentation, explanations about dependencies, or any information
   that could improve the available knowledge for other developers.
3. **Ensure Quality**: Make sure the information you add is accurate, clear, and includes any necessary explanations or
   notes.
4. **Share External Resources**: If you know of any helpful external sources, feel free to add them.
